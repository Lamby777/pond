Work-in-progress temporary file upload/sharing service.

Basically like `catbox.moe`, but open-source so you can self-host it and not worry about piracy issues if someone else downloads your files. Making this for a simple user-friendly way to make a direct link to some mp4 episodes of shows for myself to watch in VR, because Catbox bans you for copyrighted uploads and nginx isn't cute enough. :3

## Important

If you're gonna host this without a password and allow any random people to upload stuff, I'm not responsible for what happens (copyright lawsuits, CSAM uploads, malware uploads, high disk usage from spammers, etc.). **You need to either set an upload password or moderate what gets uploaded to your server.** Think of it like any other service you might expose to the internet, and be very careful, okay?
