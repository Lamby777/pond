# `pond`

Work-in-progress temporary file upload/sharing service.

Basically like `catbox.moe`, but open-source so you can self-host it and not worry about getting in trouble for piracy issues if someone else downloads your files. Making this for a simple user-friendly way to make a direct link to some mp4 episodes of shows to watch in VR, because Catbox bans you for copyrighted uploads.
